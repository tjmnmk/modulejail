# Case: WR-02 / CR-01-v1.0.0 regression — SSH-host harness exit-code routing.
#
# Drives tests/run-ssh-hosts.sh against a guaranteed-unreachable host
# (the RFC 2606 `.invalid` TLD, which DNS resolvers MUST reject) and
# asserts the harness exits 2 ("unable to reach one or more hosts"),
# NOT exit 1 ("at least one host failed").
#
# Pre-T-02 the harness's host loop used:
#     if ! run_host "$host" "$label"; then
#         rc=$?
#         if [ "$rc" -eq 2 ]; then UNREACHED=$((UNREACHED+1))
#         else                      OVERALL_FAIL=$((OVERALL_FAIL+1))
#         fi
#     fi
# Under POSIX /bin/sh, dash, and bash the `$?` inside `if ! cmd; then`
# is always 0 (the inverted-condition `!` consumes the inner return
# code), so the rc=2 branch was dead and the harness misreported
# every unreachable host as OVERALL_FAIL. The T-02 fix:
#     set +e
#     run_host "$host" "real-kernel acceptance"
#     rc=$?
#     set -e
#     case "$rc" in
#         0) ;;
#         2) UNREACHED=$((UNREACHED+1)) ;;
#         *) OVERALL_FAIL=$((OVERALL_FAIL+1)) ;;
#     esac
# captures the real return code and routes correctly.
#
# Mutation-test recipe for a future reviewer who wants to confirm this
# case actually guards the fix (not just runs):
#     git log -1 --pretty=%H tests/run-ssh-hosts.sh   # remember the SHA
#     git stash push -- tests/run-ssh-hosts.sh         # but the fix is
#         # already committed, so use revert instead:
#     git revert --no-commit <T-02-commit-sha>
#     sh tests/cases/ssh-unreachable-regression.sh    # expect FAIL
#     git restore --source=HEAD --staged --worktree tests/run-ssh-hosts.sh
#     sh tests/cases/ssh-unreachable-regression.sh    # expect PASS
#
# Hermeticity contract:
# - No real SSH server is contacted (the `.invalid` TLD never resolves).
# - No ~/.ssh/config dependency (BatchMode=yes + ConnectTimeout=10 in
#   the harness already cap wall-clock and refuse password prompts).
# - No sudo requirement.
# - Total wall-clock under ~20s on macOS (one host * 10s timeout cap;
#   in practice DNS-NXDOMAIN returns in milliseconds).
