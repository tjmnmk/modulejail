# Changelog

All notable changes to ModuleJail are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.4] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- An invocation header — can be copied and pasted for reproducible results.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- New `-f` / `--fail-on-module-load` flag. When set, blocked module
  loads return a non-zero exit code (`modprobe` fails loudly) instead
  of silently succeeding with `/bin/true` / `exit 0`. Useful for
  operators running CI or Ansible against `modprobe` who want
  blacklisted-module attempts to surface as failures rather than
  silent skips. Default behavior unchanged.
- New install-line forms for the flag-on case:
    - silent form: `install <name> /bin/false`
    - logger form: `install <name> /bin/sh -c '/usr/bin/logger -t modulejail "blocked: <name>" 2>/dev/null; /bin/false'`
- Two new acceptance cases:
    - `tests/cases/fail-on-module-load-silent.sh`
    - `tests/cases/fail-on-module-load-logger.sh`

### Compatibility

- The default-off install-line bytes are byte-identical to v1.2.2 in
  both the silent and logger paths. The v1.1.4 byte-identical
  regression contract (`tests/cases/v1.1.4-regression.sh`) still
  passes (6363 / 6363 install lines).
- New header annotations when the flag is set:
    - `# install-line: /bin/false (silent, --fail-on-module-load)`
    - `# install-line: /bin/sh + logger + /bin/false (syslog tag: modulejail, --fail-on-module-load)`
  Default-off header strings unchanged.

### Credit

Proposed by @tjmnmk in [PR #4](https://github.com/jnuyens/modulejail/pull/4); applied directly with the following adjustments to fit the project's POSIX and byte-identical contracts:

- `local install_final_cmd` (a bash/ksh extension; not POSIX) replaced with explicit branching in `emit_install_line`.
- The default-off (`FAIL_ON_MODULE_LOAD=0`) logger path now preserves the trailing `; exit 0` byte-for-byte, instead of swapping to `; /bin/true`. The byte-identical contract for default behavior is intact.
- Two new acceptance cases added under `tests/cases/`.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-05-18

One-line follow-up to v1.2.1: when the host has neither `curl` nor
`wget`, the best-effort update check now leaves an operator-visible
breadcrumb instead of silently giving up.

### Added

- `check_for_updates` emits `modulejail: notice: no curl/wget in PATH,
  cannot check for update` to stderr when neither downloader is
  available on `$PATH`, then returns 0 (the function's documented
  always-succeed contract is preserved). Severity-prefix matches the
  other three `notice:` lines in the same function ("newer release
  available" etc.). Authored by @pepa65 in [PR #1].

### Notes

- `check_for_updates` is best-effort (documented at the function's
  block-comment header). Its exit code is independent of blacklist
  generation; this release does not change any exit-code semantics for
  the script's main job.
- v1.1.4 byte-identical regression: 6363/6363 install lines preserved
  (this patch does not touch the blacklist-rendering codepath).
- Packaging metadata (`packaging/{deb,rpm}/`) and `man/modulejail.8.in`
  pick up `1.2.2` via the existing `__VERSION__` substitution in
  `packaging/build.sh`; the `.TH` line in the manpage stays at
  `2026-05-18` (same calendar day as 1.2.0 / 1.2.1).

[PR #1]: https://github.com/jnuyens/modulejail/pull/1

## [1.2.1] - 2026-05-18

Bundled cleanup pass discharging four code-review findings, two
cosmetic items, and three carry-forward items from the v1.0.0 audit.
No new features, no UX changes.

### Fixed

- `parse_whitelist_file` now propagates real `awk` failures to a
  typed sysexits exit code under `set -eu`. Previously the
  `_awk_status=$?; if [ ... ne 0 ]; then exit $EX_DATAERR; fi` tail
  was dead code: `set -eu` aborts the shell at the `awk` line on any
  non-zero awk exit, before the `if` can run. The new shape brackets
  the `awk` call with `set +e` / `set -e`, captures `rc=$?`, and
  routes 65 to `EX_DATAERR` (the documented data-error path) and any
  other non-zero exit to `EX_OSERR` (awk-internal failure: OOM,
  signal, future program-edit syntax error). Fleet automation
  case-splitting on sysexits codes now reads correctly.
- `tests/run-ssh-hosts.sh` now classifies unreachable hosts as
  `UNREACHED` (harness exit 2) instead of mis-counting them as
  `OVERALL_FAIL` (exit 1). The pre-fix shape
  `if ! run_host ...; then rc=$?` captured the inverted-condition
  `!` exit (always 0 inside the `then` branch under POSIX `/bin/sh`,
  dash, and bash), so the rc=2 dispatch was dead. Replaced with
  `set +e; run_host ...; rc=$?; set -e; case "$rc" in ...`. The
  documented exit-code contract on lines 33-37 is now actually
  enforced.
- Header-annotation byte string aligned to comma form (was a
  semicolon in the implementation): `# install-line:
  /bin/true (silent, --no-syslog-logging or logger absent)`. Edited
  in modulejail, the manpage, the README, and the two logger test
  cases that asserted the byte string.
- Whitelist-file lines may now carry leading whitespace. The `awk`
  validator strips leading whitespace symmetric with the existing
  trailing-whitespace strip before the canonical-regex check, so an
  indented module name (e.g. `  vfio_pci` copy-pasted from a YAML or
  other indented source) is accepted rather than rejected as
  `EX_DATAERR`.
- README.md audited against the two v1.0.0 carry-forward items; both
  are already-discharged. The dependency list at line 122-123 already
  names `awk, comm, find, sha256sum, and standard coreutils`
  correctly (the script truly invokes none of `grep`, `sed`); the
  stale "420 lines" claim was already removed from the README in an
  earlier edit (the script has grown well past that, and any pinned
  count would invite future rot). No further edits needed.

### Security

- Defense-in-depth: `list_universe` and `list_loaded` now filter
  their output to the canonical kernel-module regex
  `^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$` before names can reach `emit_install_line`.
  Severity: medium; not user-reachable today without root-equivalent
  write access to `/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/`. Closes the documented
  "strict regex is the gate" contract for both the `--whitelist-file`
  path (already gated by `parse_whitelist_file`) AND the filesystem-
  walk path (previously un-gated). Pre-fix reproduction: a `.ko*`
  file under `/lib/modules/$KVER/` with a single quote in its
  basename flowed unescaped into the generated install line, breaking
  the shell-quoting of the logger form (`install evil'name /bin/sh
  -c '/usr/bin/logger ...'`) and causing `modprobe` to evaluate
  syntactically malformed shell at module-load time. New regression
  test `tests/cases/emit-install-line-sanitize.sh` feeds three
  adversarial characters (single quote, `$IFS`, whitespace) through
  the full pipeline under both install-line forms and asserts the
  generated file contains none of those characters in any
  install-line module-name token.

### Changed

- `tests/run-fixtures.sh` with no flags now ALWAYS runs every
  host-local case under `tests/cases/*.sh` (15 cases as of v1.2.1).
  The container distro matrix (arch, alpine, opensuse) is additive
  when a docker or podman runtime is available. Pre-fix, the
  no-container-runtime path exited 77 without running anything, so
  the host-local cases under `tests/cases/` (whitelist-file-*,
  logger-*, v1.1.4-regression) were silently skipped on every
  developer-laptop invocation.

### Added

- `tests/cases/ssh-unreachable-regression.sh`: regression guard for
  the SSH-host harness exit-code routing fix. Drives the harness
  against a guaranteed-unreachable host
  (`unreachable-modulejail-test-host.invalid`, RFC 2606 reserved
  TLD), asserts harness exit 2 and `UNREACHABLE` SUMMARY token.
  Hermetic: no real SSH server, no `~/.ssh/config` dependency, no
  sudo; total wall-clock <100ms on the dev box.
- `tests/cases/emit-install-line-sanitize.sh`: regression guard for
  the defense-in-depth filter. Builds a synthetic
  `/lib/modules/$KVER/kernel/` tree with three adversarial `.ko`
  basenames, runs `modulejail` under both install-line forms,
  asserts the generated blacklist contains no adversarial characters
  in any install-line module-name token. Mutation-tested against a
  pre-fix `modulejail` (filter absent): correctly FAILs with
  diagnostic dumps showing the leaked install lines.

### Deferred (with rationale)

- `case-env.sh` duplication in `v1.1.4-regression.sh`:
  v1.1.4-regression's open-coded REPO_ROOT/CASE_TMP/trap boilerplate
  is kept. Refactoring `case-env.sh` to support a
  `CASE_ENV_NO_UNIVERSE` opt-out would touch the contract used by
  all 13 other host-local cases, for the marginal benefit of ~20
  fewer duplicated lines in the one case whose synthetic-tree needs
  are wildly different (6474 sharded files vs. ~63 hand-listed). The
  v1.1.4-regression case is the safety contract for the release;
  isolating its open-coded boilerplate is the lower-risk choice.
- Hardcoded dates in manpage and rpm spec: `__DATE__` substitution
  not plumbed. The rpm spec changelog inherently needs a manual
  per-release edit (new top changelog block; prior entries must NOT
  change), so `__DATE__` saves nothing there. The manpage `.TH` line
  could use `__DATE__` cleanly but it saves no release-checklist
  step (the human still has to bump VERSION and write CHANGELOG.md).
  Recorded as a release-checklist item: on every release bump
  `man/modulejail.8.in:7` `.TH` date and add a new
  `packaging/rpm/modulejail.spec.in` changelog block.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- New `--whitelist-file PATH` flag (closes [#2](https://github.com/jnuyens/modulejail/issues/2)).
  Reads a site-local whitelist file (one module name per line, `#` comments,
  blank lines ignored), validates each line against `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+`, refuses
  group- or world-writable files, and appends valid names to the in-script
  `WHITELIST`. Operators no longer lose site-local additions on
  `.deb` / `.rpm` / `curl | sh` reinstalls.
- **Default path** `/etc/modulejail/whitelist.conf`. When the flag is not
  passed and this file exists, ModuleJail auto-detects it with the same
  strict mode and content gates and prints an `info:` line on stderr so
  the choice is never silent. Addresses the silent-error-on-forgotten-flag
  concern raised by @bpmartin20 and @james-rimu in
  [#2](https://github.com/jnuyens/modulejail/issues/2).
- New `--no-whitelist-file` flag to skip the default file for a single run.
  Mutually exclusive with `--whitelist-file PATH` (combining exits
  `64 EX_USAGE` with a clear error).
- New `--no-syslog-logging` flag. Forces the v1.1.4-style
  `install <name> /bin/true` install-line body, for operators who require
  byte-identical output across versions or run on hosts without
  `/usr/bin/logger`.
- New `MODULEJAIL_LOGGER_PATH` env-var override (test-only plumbing, parallel
  to `MODULEJAIL_PROC_MODULES` / `MODULEJAIL_KVER` / `MODULEJAIL_MODULES_ROOT`).
- New `MODULEJAIL_MODULES_ROOT` env-var override (test-only plumbing) — lets
  host-local test cases on non-Linux dev boxes exercise the full pipeline
  against a synthetic `/lib/modules` tree.
- New `MODULEJAIL_DEFAULT_WHITELIST_FILE` env-var override (test-only plumbing)
  for the default-path auto-detection.
- New header annotation `# install-line: ...` documents which install-line
  form is in the generated file.
- New regression fixture under `tests/fixtures/v1.1.4-regression/` pinning
  v1.1.4 output as a permanent baseline (`tests/cases/v1.1.4-regression.sh`).
- Twelve new acceptance cases under `tests/cases/`: nine for `--whitelist-file`
  (happy path, missing file, bad permissions, malformed module name,
  comments-and-blanks, default-path used, default-path opt-out via
  `--no-whitelist-file`, dash-form normalisation regression,
  `--whitelist-file PATH` + `--no-whitelist-file` mutual exclusion),
  three for the logger install-line forms (default-on, opt-out, absent-fallback).

### Fixed

- Whitelist-file entries written in dash form (`nft-compat`) are now
  normalised to underscore form before joining the keep-set, matching the
  documented behaviour and the normalisation already applied by
  `list_baseline` / `list_whitelist` / `list_universe`. Before this fix,
  dash-form entries silently failed to match `/proc/modules`'s underscore
  form and the module was blacklisted anyway. Caught in code review
  before release.

### Changed

- **Default behaviour change:** when `/usr/bin/logger` is executable on the
  host running modulejail (and `--no-syslog-logging` is not set), generated
  install lines now call `logger -t modulejail "blocked: <name>"` so blocked
  module load attempts produce a syslog entry tagged `modulejail`. View via:
    - `journalctl -t modulejail --since '1 hour ago'` on systemd hosts
    - `grep modulejail /var/log/syslog` on syslog hosts

  Set `--no-syslog-logging` to restore the exact v1.1.4 install-line body.
  The generated file's header annotation (`# install-line: ...`) records
  which form was emitted.

### Security

- Whitelist file is rejected if its mode allows group-write or world-write
  (`mode & 022 != 0`), exiting `EX_NOPERM=77` with a `chmod go-w PATH` hint.
  Same hardening sshd applies to `authorized_keys` and sudo applies to
  `sudoers`. Each non-comment line is strictly validated against
  `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+` to prevent command injection into the generated
  `modprobe.d` file. Rejection exits `EX_DATAERR=65` with a stderr message
  citing the file path, line number, and offending content.

### Internal

- New `EX_DATAERR=65` constant in the sysexits.h block (numeric order between
  `EX_USAGE=64` and `EX_NOINPUT=66`). Documented exit code in `--help`.
- POSIX-portable octal mode parsing (no bashism `$((8#$x))`); shellcheck
  `--shell=sh` clean.
- Pre-existing latent bug fixed: the `cleanup()` EXIT trap's
  `[ -n "$tmp" ] && rm -f "$tmp"` last command silently clobbered explicit
  `exit $EX_*` codes under dash/POSIX `/bin/sh` whenever `$tmp` was still
  empty. Rewritten as an `if`/`then` block with an explicit trailing
  `return 0`. Surfaced by the new whitelist-file rejection paths.
- `tests/run-fixtures.sh` gained `--filter PATTERN` mode for host-local case
  scripts under `tests/cases/`; the default no-flag mode (full distro fixture
  matrix) is unchanged.
- Header annotation does NOT enter the fingerprint computation (fingerprint
  is a function of canonical inputs — kernel, profile, loaded, baseline,
  whitelist — not render-time decisions). Two runs on identical inputs with
  different `--no-syslog-logging` states therefore produce different
  install-line bodies but the same `# fingerprint:` line, preserving the
  v1.0.0 fleet-correlation contract.

### Drivers

- GitHub [Issue #2](https://github.com/jnuyens/modulejail/issues/2)
  (bpmartin20) — external whitelist persistence ask.
- Vincent Homans (email feedback, 2026-05-13) — syslog visibility ask and
  modprobe-override-scope clarification ask.

## [1.1.4] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- Project logo on the README.

### Changed

- Container fixture is version-agnostic (no longer hardcoded to `1.0.0`
  strings) and gains four new assertions covering the v1.1.x update-check
  surface, including a static regression guard against the v1.1.2
  busybox-wget bug.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed

- Update check now works on Alpine / busybox wget. The wget invocation used
  GNU long-form flags (`--quiet`, `--max-redirect=5`, `--output-document=-`)
  that busybox wget rejects, causing the check to silently exit non-zero on
  every Alpine host. Switched to the universal short-flag subset
  (`-q`, `-T 10`, `-O -`) and dropped `--max-redirect` (the GitHub tags API
  does not redirect).

## [1.1.2] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- `modulejail(8)` manpage, installed at `/usr/share/man/man8/modulejail.8.gz`.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-05-12

### Changed

- Swap the order of `Why?` and `What ModuleJail is` in the README so the
  motivation leads.
- Drop the per-distro `%dist` suffix from the RPM filename (was
  `modulejail-X.Y.Z-1.el9.noarch.rpm`, now `modulejail-X.Y.Z-1.noarch.rpm`).
  ModuleJail is a noarch shell script with no per-major-RHEL semantics.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- `.deb` and `.rpm` packaging under `packaging/` with
  `packaging/build.sh` driver.
- Optional post-run check for a newer release on GitHub: silent on any
  failure mode, 10-second hard timeout, only complains when reachable and a
  newer tag exists. Honours `MODULEJAIL_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=<any non-empty>`
  to disable.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-12

### Changed

- Documentation cleanup release.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- Initial release. Single POSIX shell script that snapshots
  `/proc/modules`, walks `/lib/modules/$(uname -r)`, computes the complement
  against a built-in baseline plus the sysadmin `WHITELIST`, and writes a
  `modprobe.d` blacklist file.
- Three baseline profiles (`minimal`, `conservative`, `desktop`).
- SemVer `VERSION` constant; sysexits.h-aligned exit codes
  (`64`, `66`, `70`, `71`, `73`, `77`).
- Deterministic SHA-256 fingerprint header — byte-identical idempotency on
  identical inputs.
- Cross-distro support (Debian/Ubuntu, RHEL/Rocky/Fedora, Arch, Alpine,
  openSUSE) with no per-distro code branches.
- Container fixture harness (`tests/run-fixtures.sh`) and SSH-host
  acceptance harness (`tests/run-ssh-hosts.sh`).
- GPL-3.0-only license.
