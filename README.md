</p>

A single POSIX shell script that shrinks a Linux host's kernel-module attack
surface by writing a `modprobe.d` blacklist for every kernel module not
currently in use, minus a built-in baseline and an optional sysadmin
whitelist. No daemons, no initramfs changes, no AI inside the tool. One
script, one run, one blacklist file.

## Why?

AI-assisted security scanning is about to do to the Linux kernel what
large-scale fuzzing did to userspace code a decade ago, only faster and at a
much larger scale. Many years of latent privilege-escalation bugs in kernel
modules are about to surface in quick succession over the coming weeks and
months. Long term, this is a major win for kernel security: every disclosure
closes a door that an attacker could otherwise have walked through unseen.
Short term, it is a nightmare for sysadmins. Every public release brings
another race against patch cycles, vendor backports, and reboots across
thousands of hosts.

ModuleJail does not try to fix kernel bugs, and it cannot. It does the one
thing a sysadmin can do today, on any host, in seconds: shrink the attack
surface so that the next disclosed bug is more likely to land on a module the
host is not even loading. A typical Linux host ships with several thousand
kernel modules and uses a few hundred. ModuleJail blacklists the rest. The
next CVE in the unused 90% becomes a non-event on that host, and the fleet
operator buys time to schedule the patch on their own terms instead of
emergency-paging at 03:00.

This is intentionally a boring tool. No AI inside it, no daemon, no
continuous monitoring, no risk scoring, no CVE database lookups. Just one
shell script, run once on a steady-state host, that writes
`/etc/modprobe.d/modulejail-blacklist.conf` to blacklist the thousands of
unused modules, specific to your system.

## Quickstart

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jnuyens/modulejail/v1.1.4/modulejail | sudo sh
```

> **WARNING: convenient, not safe.** This pipes unverified bytes from the
> network to a root shell. The safer alternative below is the recommended path.

The script writes its blacklist to `/etc/modprobe.d/modulejail-blacklist.conf`
by default. To use a different path:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jnuyens/modulejail/v1.1.4/modulejail | sudo sh -s -- -o /etc/modprobe.d/site-blacklist.conf
```

## The safer alternative

Download, inspect, then run:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jnuyens/modulejail/v1.1.4/modulejail -o /tmp/modulejail
less /tmp/modulejail
sudo sh /tmp/modulejail
```

This is the recommended path for any production deployment. The script is
plain POSIX shell and inspection takes under ten minutes.

## Native packages (.deb / .rpm)

For Debian/Ubuntu and RHEL/Fedora/Rocky hosts, prebuilt packages are attached
to the GitHub release page:

```sh
# Debian / Ubuntu:
curl -fsSLO https://github.com/jnuyens/modulejail/releases/download/v1.1.4/modulejail_1.1.4_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i modulejail_1.1.4_all.deb

# RHEL / Fedora / Rocky:
curl -fsSLO https://github.com/jnuyens/modulejail/releases/download/v1.1.4/modulejail-1.1.4-1.noarch.rpm
sudo rpm -i modulejail-1.1.4-1.noarch.rpm
```

Both packages install `/usr/bin/modulejail`, the `modulejail(8)` manpage
under `/usr/share/man/man8/`, and the README and LICENSE under
`/usr/share/doc/modulejail/`. They depend on `coreutils`, `findutils`, and
`awk`/`gawk` (all standard) and recommend `curl` or `wget` so the optional
post-run update check can reach GitHub.

After install, `man 8 modulejail` shows the full reference: options,
profiles, safety model, idempotency, exit codes, environment, and examples.

To rebuild the packages locally from a checkout:

```sh
./packaging/build.sh           # builds whatever this host's tooling supports
./packaging/build.sh --deb     # .deb only (requires dpkg-deb)
./packaging/build.sh --rpm     # .rpm only (requires rpmbuild)
```

Output goes to `packaging/dist/`. The script skips gracefully on hosts
without the matching tooling.

## What ModuleJail is

ModuleJail snapshots the set of currently loaded modules (`/proc/modules`) and
computes the complement against the full module tree
(`/lib/modules/$(uname -r)`). Every module in the complement, minus a built-in
baseline of essential modules and an optional sysadmin-supplied whitelist, is
emitted as an `install <mod> /bin/true` directive in a `modprobe.d`-compatible
blacklist file.

The tool is aimed at Linux fleet operators who need to harden many servers
against the wave of AI-assisted kernel privilege-escalation discoveries. Every
additional loaded module is additional latent attack surface for the next
disclosed CVE. ModuleJail's model is simple: if it is not loaded today on a
steady-state host, blacklist it.

The script is portable across Debian/Ubuntu, RHEL/Rocky, Arch, Alpine, and
SUSE families. It has no runtime dependencies beyond `awk`, `comm`, `find`,
`sha256sum`, and standard coreutils, all present in every base Linux install
including busybox.

## The safety model

The invariant is: **whatever is currently loaded is assumed necessary for the
host to function, and is preserved.** ModuleJail does not guess; it reads
`/proc/modules` at run time and treats that exact set as the keep-list.

This means the operator's responsibility is to run ModuleJail when the host
is in a known-good, steady-state configuration: after all services are
started, all kernel drivers are loaded, all filesystems are mounted. Running
it on a partial or in-flux system risks blacklisting a module that is
occasionally needed.

The generated file is placed under `/etc/modprobe.d/`. To revert, remove the
file and reboot (see the Reverting section). The built-in baseline ensures
that core filesystems, storage controllers, and essential networking modules
are never blacklisted regardless of the running profile.

## Explicit limitations

- **No initramfs handling.** Modules baked into initramfs are out of scope.
  The loaded-module surface is the target; baked-in modules are not the
  relevant attack vector.
- **No revert tooling.** The revert path is "remove the generated file and
  reboot." Sysadmin discipline replaces tool guardrails.
- **No daemon or continuous monitoring.** One-shot script by design.
- **No AI inside the tool.** AI is the threat-model backdrop, not a feature.
- **No per-distro packaging in v1.** The curl one-liner and a cloned repo
  are the distribution channels.
- **No module risk scoring.** The model is "unused implies blacklist," not
  "vulnerable implies blacklist."
- **No kernel rebuild.** Runtime blacklist only.

## Profiles

ModuleJail ships three built-in baseline profiles. The selected profile
determines which modules are always preserved regardless of loaded state.

```sh
# Profile selection via -p (default: conservative)
sudo sh modulejail -p conservative
sudo sh modulejail -p minimal
sudo sh modulejail -p desktop
```

Profile descriptions (from `--help`):

```
  minimal       Core filesystems + essential kernel modules only
  conservative  Minimal + common server/VM drivers (default)
  desktop       Conservative + WiFi, Bluetooth, audio, video drivers
```

`conservative` is the right choice for virtualised or bare-metal server
Linux. `desktop` is for laptops and workstations where WiFi, Bluetooth,
audio, and video drivers must be preserved. `minimal` is for environments
where you have full control over which drivers are loaded and want the
smallest possible baseline.

## The sysadmin whitelist

A site-local `WHITELIST` variable near the top of the script holds
space-separated module names that are always preserved, beyond the selected
baseline. It ships empty.

To use it, open the script and find the `=== SYSADMIN WHITELIST ===` section:

```sh
# === SYSADMIN WHITELIST ===
# Site-local additions to the keep-set, in addition to the selected baseline
# profile. Modules listed here will never appear in the generated blacklist.
#
# Format: space-separated module names in canonical underscore form
#         (the pipeline normalizes - to _, so either form works).
# Default: empty.
#
# Example (uncomment and adapt):
# WHITELIST='nft_compat xt_owner'
WHITELIST=''
# === END SYSADMIN WHITELIST ===
```

Edit `WHITELIST=''` to add your site-specific modules. The `===` banner
anchors are designed for Ansible template insertion (`lineinfile` or
`blockinfile`).

## Exit codes

Exit codes follow `sysexits.h` conventions (see `man 3 sysexits`). Fleet
automation tools can `case $?` cleanly.

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0    | success |
| 64   | command-line argument error (bad flag, missing value, unknown profile) |
| 66   | required kernel input missing (`/proc/modules` or `/lib/modules/<kernel>`) |
| 70   | sanity guard tripped (empty blacklist or >99% of modules blacklisted) |
| 71   | OS-level error (mktemp work dir, or find errors on `/lib/modules`) |
| 73   | output path cannot be created (symlink/directory/trailing-slash, or mktemp failure) |
| 77   | target directory not writable (try sudo, or use `-o <other-path>`) |

## Idempotency contract

Two consecutive runs on an unchanged host produce byte-identical output
files. The generated blacklist header carries a sha256 run fingerprint, not
a wall-clock timestamp, computed over the canonical inputs: sorted
loaded-module set, sorted baseline set, sorted whitelist, profile name, and
kernel version. Because the fingerprint is a deterministic function of
inputs, identical inputs produce an identical fingerprint and thus an
identical output file.

```
# fingerprint: sha256:e284ee9741eb544adf1af6c0fffc162dedd6029191673237a8155cd497908686
```

Fleet operators can use the fingerprint to correlate "what was on the host
at hardening time" across machines: two hosts with the same fingerprint had
identical loaded sets, baseline, whitelist, profile, and kernel version when
ModuleJail ran. No wall-clock drift, no spurious diffs in configuration
management systems.

## Update check

After a successful run, ModuleJail performs a best-effort lookup against the
GitHub tags API to see whether a newer release is available. The check has a
10-second hard timeout and is silent on every failure mode (no network, no
`curl` or `wget` installed, parse failure, current version equal to or newer
than the latest tag). It only prints a stderr notice when the upstream
release is strictly newer than the running version.

To disable the check entirely (for offline fleets, restricted networks, or
pipeline-style automation where any unexpected output is noise), set:

```sh
export MODULEJAIL_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1
```

The check fires only on a successful run. Error paths (bad arguments,
missing `/proc/modules`, sanity-guard trip, etc.) exit before reaching it.

## Cross-distro support

ModuleJail has been verified across two confidence tiers.

### Real-kernel tier (live SSH hosts)

| Distro | Kernel | Result |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS (Noble Numbat) | 6.8.0-110-generic | PASS (6363 of 6474 modules blacklisted) |
| Debian GNU/Linux 13.4 (trixie) | 6.12.74+deb13+1-amd64 | PASS (4091 of 4227 modules blacklisted) |
| Rocky Linux 9.7 (Blue Onyx) | 5.14.0-503.35.1.el9_5.x86_64 | PASS (2253 of 2338 modules blacklisted) |

Note for Rocky/RHEL hosts: on hosts with strict SELinux enforcement,
non-root execution may encounter a `find` permission denial on
`/lib/modules/`, causing exit code 71 (`EX_OSERR`). This is expected,
documented behaviour. Use `sudo`, or relax the relevant SELinux policy, if
this occurs.

### Fixture-container tier (synthetic kernel module trees)

| Distro | Base image | Shell | Result |
|--------|-----------|-------|--------|
| Arch Linux (latest) | `archlinux:latest` | `/bin/sh` (bash) | PASS (10/10 assertions) |
| Alpine Linux (latest) | `alpine:latest` | busybox ash | PASS (10/10 assertions) |
| openSUSE Tumbleweed | `opensuse/tumbleweed:latest` | `/bin/sh` | PASS (10/10 assertions) |

Fixture containers run against a synthetic
`/lib/modules/6.99.0-fixture/` tree with representative `.ko`, `.ko.gz`,
`.ko.xz`, and `.ko.zst` files to exercise all four suffix variants.

The `MODULEJAIL_PROC_MODULES` and `MODULEJAIL_KVER` environment variables
are test-only plumbing (analogous to `TMPDIR` or `GIT_DIR`) used by the
fixture harness to point the script at synthetic `/proc/modules` and module
tree paths. End-user operators leave these unset.

## Reverting

Remove the generated file under `/etc/modprobe.d/` and reboot, or `modprobe`
the specific modules you need back without rebooting.

```sh
# Full revert (requires reboot):
sudo rm /etc/modprobe.d/modulejail-blacklist.conf
sudo reboot

# Selective reload without reboot (bring back a specific module):
sudo modprobe <module_name>
```

The generated file uses `install <module> /bin/true` directives, which block
autoloading. Explicitly loading with `modprobe` overrides the blacklist for
the current boot session only; the restriction re-applies after the next
reboot unless the file has been removed.

## Contributing

The test matrix lives in `tests/`. Both harnesses are POSIX shell scripts
runnable by anyone with the prerequisites:

```sh
# Container fixture suite (Arch/Alpine/openSUSE):
# Requires: docker or podman; exits 77 if neither is found (graceful skip).
./tests/run-fixtures.sh

# Real-SSH-host acceptance suite:
# Requires: SSH key access to the hosts configured in the harness.
./tests/run-ssh-hosts.sh
```

`./tests/run-fixtures.sh` exits 77 on any host without a container runtime;
that is the documented graceful degradation (autoconf/TAP skip convention).
Run it on a Linux host with Docker or Podman.

Both harnesses are shellcheck-clean (`shellcheck --shell=sh`).
